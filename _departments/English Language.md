<h4><strong><u>English Language Department Processes</u></strong></h4>
<p>Vision: Every Child an Effective, Empathetic and Confident Communicator</p>
<p>Proficiency in the English Language is necessary in today’s increasingly
connected and global environment. It is important to be able to communicate
effectively, but equal importance must also be placed in communicating
confidently and empathetically. In order to achieve our vision, Sembawang
Primary School English Language teachers are guided by a pedagogical approach
that closely aligns to our Ministry of Education’s direction.</p>
<p>We believe that a multiliterate student will be best poised to take on
the role of an effective, empathetic and confident communicator. Therefore,
our lessons are rich in multiliteracies and multimodal texts in order to
ignite joy and rigour in learning.</p>
<p>A multiliterate student is one who is able to critically read multiple
modes of communication (e.g. printed texts with accompanying visuals, digital
animations, music and sound effects etc.) while also taking into account
socio-cultural factors. Students learn to read critically through Curriculum
Innovation lessons where inquiry through dialogue takes place and metacognitive
skills are practised. Below are some photos taken during these lessons:</p>

<p><strong><u>Authentic Learning Experiences Beyond the Classroom</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensory Path</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sensory Path is a creative collaboration between the English Language
and Physical Education departments — a vibrant, interactive space designed
to stimulate both body and mind.</p>

<p>Through a series of colourful stations and walkways, our Lower Primary
and MOE Kindergarten (MK) students explore language in a multi-sensory
environment. As they walk, jump, and engage with tactile, visual, and auditory
elements, they’re not just moving — they’re learning.</p>
<p><strong>What It Supports:</strong>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Language acquisition through interactive
word play and instructions</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development of motor skills and spatial
awareness</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical thinking through hands-on tasks
and exploration</p>
<p>By merging movement with literacy, the Sensory Path transforms traditional
lessons into dynamic, joyful experiences — helping students grow as confident
learners in every sense.</p>

</p>
<p>Our Primary 1 students had an exciting day of discovery at the Singapore
Zoo! They were thrilled to watch Tiago the Sea Lion perform at the Splash
Safari Show, followed by a fun exploration of the zoo’s many animal exhibits.
Back in school, they turned their adventure into thoughtful reflections,
combining real-world experiences with creative writing.</p>

<p>In previous seasons, we had resident DJs who hosted the entire season.
But this year, the team is grooming a wider pool of student presenters
from across different levels. This inclusive approach ensures more students
get the chance to try their hand at presenting to the entire school — building
confidence and showcasing talent.</p>
<p>It’s not just a radio show — it’s a platform where young voices grow stronger
every season.</p>

<h3><strong>Building Skills and Confidence</strong></h3>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students craft their own scripts and presentation
slides</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They practise public speaking and oracy
skills with guidance from teachers</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers review scripts to support clarity
and accuracy in communication</p>
<p>Even our youngest students have shown remarkable enthusiasm and courage
in stepping up to present — a true testament to the supportive, student-led
culture we strive to build.</p>
<p><strong><u>Literacy Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buddy Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>At Sembawang Primary, we believe that every child can become a confident
reader. Our Buddy Reading Programme nurtures this belief by pairing strong
P2 readers with P1 students who need a little extra support in their reading
journey.</p>
<p><strong>When &amp; Where:<br></strong>&nbsp;Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays
<br>&nbsp;7.15am – 7.30am @ Indoor Sports Hall (ISH)</p>
<p><strong>How It Works:</strong>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P2 buddies are specially trained by our
teachers to read patiently and supportively</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P1 students benefit from peer encouragement
in a relaxed, low-pressure setting</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together, they build reading confidence,
fluency, and joy</p>
<p>This meaningful morning programme fosters not just literacy, but also
empathy, responsibility, and collaboration — values that go far beyond
the page.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writer’s Toolbox</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of an ongoing partnership with <em>The Writer's Toolbox</em>, upper
primary students at Sembawang Primary embarked on this journey to strengthen
their writing skills through structured strategies and creative expression.
This collaboration with <em>The Writer's Toolbox </em>aims to equip our
learners with essential tools to plan, draft, and refine their writing
with greater clarity and confidence. Through engaging lessons and hands-on
activities, students are guided to become more effective communicators
and critical thinkers. The Writer's Toolbox continues to support our vision
of nurturing articulate, thoughtful, and expressive writers in every classroom.</p>
<p><strong><u>Experiential Learning Week</u></strong>
</p>
<p>During the Experiential Learning Week held in Week 9 of Term 1, our students
engage in experiential and interdisciplinary learning beyond the usual
curriculum. Below are some memorable photos that capture the highlights
of the week this year.</p>
<p><strong>P1 - Designed Creative Book Covers</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Primary 1 students designed their own book covers using recycled materials
to promote the 3Rs — Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. They learnt about the
parts of a book cover, such as the title, spine, and blurb, and created
covers for Earth Day or World Water Day. Through this hands-on project,
students used their creativity while learning how to care for the environment!</p>
