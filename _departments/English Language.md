### English Language

**Vision: Every Child an Effective, Empathetic and Confident Communicator**

     Proficiency in English Language is even more necessary in today’s increasingly connected and global environment. It is not only important to be able to communicate effectively, but equally important to communicate confidently and empathetically. In order to achieve our vision, Sembawang Primary School English Language teachers are guided by a pedagogical approach that closely aligns to our Ministry of Education’s direction.

     We believe that a multiliterate student will be best poised to take on the role of an effective, empathetic and confident communicator. Therefore, our lessons are rich in multiliteracies and multimodal texts in order to ignite joy and rigour in learning.

     A multiliterate student is one who is able to critically read multiple modes of communication (e.g. printed texts with accompanying visuals, digital animations, music and sound effects etc) while also taking into account socio-cultural factors. Students learn to read critically through Curriculum Innovation lessons where inquiry through dialogues take place and metacognitive skills are practised. Below are some photos taken during these lessons.

**Learning Outside the Classroom**

     In order to be empathetic communicators, students have to be aware of their socio-cultural environment. Therefore, we provide rich learning experiences such as the theatre experiences and learning journeys.

  
Learning Journeys in 2021

  
P1: Virtual zoo  
P2: Growing Butterflies in our Garden City  
P3: Alice in the Wonderland  
P4: Hansel and Greta  
P5 and P6: Digitalised Drama Shows on the differences between English, Singlish and Broken English.

  

Sensory Path 

  

          The sensory path is an inter-departmental initiative between the English Language and Physical Education departments. This learning path combines the kinaesthetic and cognitive faculties of the child as they navigate the colourful and exciting stations and walkways. This sensory path pays homage to our school song’s chorus: Learning is an adventure; Learning is fun!

**Differentiated Programmes to support our students**

     On top of our usual classroom lessons that happen during curriculum time, we offer differentiated programmes to cater to students of different needs. They range from HAL to Pull-Out programmes. The goal is always to match our students to their readiness level so that they are always progressing steadily to becoming effective, empathetic and confident communicators.

**Booster Programmes**

Learning Support Programme (LSP) Khadijah

     LSP-trained teachers spend half an hour a day with small groups of 8 to 10 students with a focus on building their English Language skills.

  

School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) Khadijah

     This remediation programme utilises internationally tested and proven methods to teach reading and spelling to students belonging to the dyslexic profile. For instance, our SDR-trained teachers teach these students to make the connections between letters and sounds, as well as read text explicitly with methods that involve multiple senses such as sight, sound, movement and touch.

Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)

     The RRP seeks to equip students with reading challenges the right skills to help them understand what they are reading. The aim is to teach students to understand the text that will allow them to fully appreciate the story plot. In so doing, these students will be able to read for enjoyment and academic excellence.

**Reading Programme**

     Our reading programme is an extension programme that encourages every student in our school to read.

  

Hi DEAR!

     Hi DEAR is a signature reading programme in our school in collaboration with the Mother Tongue department. This programme is structured into the language curriculum to build a positive reading culture while increasing students’ interest, competency and literacy standards. All P1 to P6 English classes will alternate fornightly between their scheduled library periods and Hi DEAR! activities at the respective levels:  

  
P1-P2: Inculcation Values through Stories 

     Inculcating moral values in students through values-based storybooks and extended activities based on each story.

  
P3 and P4: Online Reading Portal 

     Building independent, confident readers through an online reading portal with a wide selection of fiction and non-fiction content based on students’ interests and individual reading level.

  
P5 and P6: What’sUp newspaper 

     The What’sUp newspaper complements the regular classroom with current affairs and anecdotes from the other parts of the world. Students keep abreast with what is happening around the world at the same time as they learn English Language skills.

  

**Reading Champion**  
     This Reading Champion Programme is collaboration with our Mother Tongue department where students record (both English and Mother Tongue) books that they had read. A Reading Champion Booklet will be used to record the title of books or newspaper articles that students have read in order to consolidate their reading journey. Students will be awarded badges after reading the required target number of books. Badges come in bronze, silver and gold. We believe a well-read reader will have a broad knowledge base for them to tap on when they are communicating their ideas to others.

  

**Media Resource Library**

     A beautifully decorated library invites students to revisit it again and again. Our library is a beautiful and conducive place for book lovers!

**Competitions**

     Our students are given many platforms to showcase their talents and abilities. We hope these platforms spur them to reach out beyond their comfort zone to excel in their respective areas of expertise.

     We are pleased to announce that two of our primary three students received merit awards in the Singapore Moo-O Awards 2000 in collaboration with the Speak Good English Movement. Our students used the Moo-O software to portray themselves as various story characters. They also narrated their stories fluently and expressively in order to clinch the awards!

  

SOTA Creative Writing Competition 

     We continuously look for opportunities for our students to participate in national-level creative writing competitions. Last year, two of our student’s entries (out of a total of 1514 entries) were shortlisted in SOTA Creative Writing Competition 2020! We are proud of their achievements and look forward to groom more aspiring writers for similar competitions this year.
