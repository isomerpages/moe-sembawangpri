<h4><strong><u>English Language Department Processes</u></strong></h4>

<p>Vision: Every Child an Effective, Empathetic and Confident Communicator</p>
<p>Proficiency in the English Language is necessary in today’s increasingly
connected and global environment. It is important to be able to communicate
effectively, but equal importance must also be placed in communicating
confidently and empathetically. In order to achieve our vision, Sembawang
Primary School English Language teachers are guided by a pedagogical approach
that closely aligns to our Ministry of Education’s direction.</p>
<p>We believe that a multiliterate student will be best poised to take on
the role of an effective, empathetic and confident communicator. Therefore,
our lessons are rich in multiliteracies and multimodal texts in order to
ignite joy and rigour in learning.</p>
<p>A multiliterate student is one who is able to critically read multiple
modes of communication (e.g. printed texts with accompanying visuals, digital
animations, music and sound effects etc.) while also taking into account
socio-cultural factors. Students learn to read critically through Curriculum
Innovation lessons where inquiry through dialogue takes place and metacognitive
skills are practised. Below are some photos taken during these lessons:</p>

<p><strong><u>Authentic Learning Experiences Beyond the Classroom</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensory Path</strong>
</p>
<p>The sensory path began as an inter-departmental initiative between the
English Language and Physical Education departments. It is a vibrant amalgamation
of engaging stations and walkways designed to stimulate both the physical
and cognitive abilities of our learners. Lower Primary teachers, as well
as MK teachers, conduct lessons with their students as they explore the
interactive Sensory Path for enriched learning experiences. As they journey
through this dynamic space, our young learners are encouraged to harness
their kinesthetic instincts while also engaging with visual, auditory,
and tactile stimuli.</p>
<p>By immersing students in this multi-sensory environment, the English Department
aims to enhance their acquisition of linguistic and fundamental psychomotor
skills. Through hands-on activities and immersive experiences, the collaborative
effort between departments and the kindergarten promises to create a rich
educational tapestry that nurtures holistic development.</p>

<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning Journey to the Singapore Zoo</strong>
</p>
<p>The school organised a learning journey to the Singapore Zoo for the Primary
1 students. The students watched a performance by Tiago the Sealion at
the Splash Safari Show. After watching the show, they walked around the
zoo where they were introduced to different wild animals. Once they returned
to school, they were tasked to do a writing reflection based on their learning
experience. They enjoyed the outdoor learning experience at the Singapore
Zoo!</p>

<p>Over the years, our radio show has become a platform to showcase student
dedications and achievements. In allowing our students to present the radio
show to their schoolmates, “Good Morning Sembawang!” has allowed for the
development of our students’ voices and promoted active student agency.</p>
<p>Season 3 of “Good Morning, Sembawang!” is slightly different from the
earlier seasons, with the following considerations in mind:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DJ/Presenters’
training</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nurturing confident
and fluent speakers</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognising students’
efforts and achievements&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interviews with
students who had done well for any external competition</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More airtime for
students’ dedications</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiz based on
interview session to engage attentive listening</p>

<p>In previous seasons, we had resident DJs who hosted the complete season.
This year, the “Good Morning, Sembawang!” team wanted to train more students
from different levels so that a wider range of students could be given
the opportunity to try their hand at presenting to the entire school.</p>

<p>Some of our DJs are also roped in to brainstorm ideas for certain segments
of the show which allows them to work on their script writing skills. We

looks forward to and is one of the main highlights of the English Department.</p>

<p>The programme “Faces of Sembawang” was created to promote students’ voices
and student agency. It serves as a platform for students to share about
their interests to the entire school. Some examples include:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hobbies</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skill that the
student had learnt / is learning</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun facts</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Book recommendations</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something that
the student had created</p>
<p>Not only can the students learn from each other, they also get to learn
more things about each other! This programme is conducted monthly at the
ISH &amp; MPH catering to the lower primary students as well. The English
Language teachers work closely with the “Faces of Sembawang” team to nominate
potential students for the programmes.</p>
<p>The student presenters prepare their own script and deck of slides to
showcase in front of the audience. Through this programme, students are
exposed to writing draft scripts for their presentation to the cohort.
They also get to hone their oracy skills by speaking confidently with appropriate
pronunciation and fluency. Teachers assist the selected student presenters
by checking their content and language in their scripts and slides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The success of the show is evident when even lower primary students
have shown great enthusiasm and volunteered to come forward to present
for “Faces of Sembawang”!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving forward, the “Faces of Sembawang” team will be collaborating with
other departments like Science, Art and MTL to identify students who have
an interest in niche areas to present for the programme.

<p><strong><u>Literacy Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Reading plays an important part in language development and is key to
understanding the world at large. In Sembawang Primary, we believe that
all students are capable of learning to read and understand what they are
reading. To aid students in their reading journey, the English Department
has outlined several programmes to supplement their learning.</p>

<p>Since 2022, Sembawang Primary School has been collaborating with the National
Library Board (NLB) to conduct a nationwide reading programme called KidsRead.
This programme promotes the love of reading and cultivates good reading
habits among young children. The KidsRead Club is conducted by volunteers
trained by NLB and coordinated by our teachers-in-charge from SBPS. The
students enjoy listening to the books read by volunteers and doing hands-on
activities that spark their imagination and creativity based on the theme
of the books.&nbsp;</p>

to provide support and encouragement in developing their reading skills.
The reading sessions take place from 7.15am to 7.30am at the Indoor Sports
Hall (ISH) on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. Our P2 buddies
have been trained by teachers from SBPS to effectively support their peers
in improving their reading skills.</p>

<p><strong><u>Experiential Learning Week</u></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;During the Experiential Learning Week in Week 10 of Term 1, students
were immersed in a series of enriching experiences that transcended the
boundaries of conventional curriculum. This unique opportunity enabled
them to acquire skills essential for navigating the complexities of the
21st century. Our carefully curated activities integrated both traditional
and contemporary elements, along with interdisciplinary programs, fostering
a holistic approach to learning. Through hands-on engagement, students
not only gained knowledge but also applied it across diverse subject areas.
The Experiential Learning Week was truly a catalyst for igniting the joy
of learning among our students!</p>

this year.</p>
