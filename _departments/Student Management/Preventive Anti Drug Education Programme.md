### Preventive Anti-Drug Education Programme

Did you know that about 62% of new drug abusers and arrested in Singapore were below 30 years old. Hence, in SBPS, we believe that it is necessary to equip our students with knowledge about the danger of drug abuse and equip our students with refusal skill at the young age through a planned yearly programme.
