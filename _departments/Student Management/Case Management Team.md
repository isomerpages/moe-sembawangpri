### CMT

**Introduction**

In Sembawang Primary School (SBPS), the Student Development Team (SDT) looks into the holistic development of students, across both academic and non-academic areas. Under the SDT, is the Case Management Team (CMT) – a school-level team comprising personnel with different areas of expertise. It serves as the nucleus for overall management of students with additional needs in the areas of academic, behavioural, social and emotional needs (including at-risk students and those with SEN).

**Rationale**

Articulated in our school philosophy, in SBPS, we believe in providing a holistic education to help every child discover joy of learning in a safe and caring environment. Helping ‘every child’ means leaving no child behind because of their background, profile or abilities. As such, through the composition of the CMT, the school hopes to leverage on.
