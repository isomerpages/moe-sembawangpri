### Discipline
_“It’s your road, and yours alone, others may walk it with you, but no one can walk it for you.” – Rumi_

  

Welcome to SBPS Discipline Webpage!

  

At SBPS, we seek to provide a welcoming and caring environment where every member of the school community feels valued and respected and that each person is treated fairly and well. We are a caring community, whose values are built on care and respect for all. It aims to promote an environment where everyone feels happy, safe and secure.

  

The Discipline Framework Approach:

  

**C** – Care Approach

**A** – Accepting the differences

**R** – Reminding always

**E** – Empowering the students

  

This approach takes into account various models that focuses on holistic development, intervention, reconciliation, restoration and collaboration. It also emphasizes the building of quality relationship in the school community. The Discipline Framework Approach is explained as follows:

  

**Care Approach**

*    Whole school approach towards discipline
*    Every teacher is a disciplinarian and counsellour
*    Differs only in level of intervention
*    Form teachers and subject teachers must work together
*    Case Management Team (CMT )will assist, if needed to
*    Be seen as firm and fair
*    Make time to explain any deviation of actions taken
*    Firm and fair does not equate to diminishing remarks or actions

  

**Accepting the differences**

*         Every child is unique
*   Get to know every student
*   Every class is different
*   Get to know the dynamics of the class
*   Different characters within the class
*   Wide repertoire of classroom management tactics and tricks

  

**Reminding Always**

*   Drop reminders at times
*   Positive reminders work better to enforce positive behaviours
*   Practise effective follow through actions

  

**Empowering the students**

*   Maintain high expectations on students
*   Trusting the students to do the right action always
*   Trust needs to be well-placed
*   Emphasise that trust comes with great responsibility
