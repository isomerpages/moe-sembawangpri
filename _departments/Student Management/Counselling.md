### Counselling

The School Counsellor supports students by helping them learn and use strategies to manage and cope with their emotions or situations and enables them to make choice for positive change and development.

At SBPS Counselling Services organized in a tiered system.

·          Tier 1 Support by teachers

Students are encouraged to talk to their teachers who will provide the first level of support.

·          Tier 2 Referral to counsellors

Students who need specialized attention will be referred to a Teacher-Counsellor or School Counsellor. School Counsellor also provides early intervention for students facing social, emotional or mental challenges.

·          Referral to specialists or community agencies

Students who require more intensive intervention will be referred to Lead Counsellor or mental health professionals from REACH or social service agencies.

Parents’/Guardians’ consent would be required, and their active partnership will be sought. School Counsellor will plan targeted intervention plan for at-risk pupils who need help in the area of social emotional development. Students who require more intense intervention will be referred to MOE Guidance Specialists or professional agencies, such as the Child Guidance Clinic.

I believe every child can learn and achieve their fullest potential when given appropriate support through specialised interventions to manage issues such as anger, grief/loss, fear, trauma, stress and low self-esteem. Also, I work with external agencies to provide support the wellbeing of the child and family. The profession gives me a lot of satisfaction although at times I have to face challenges. I feel happy when the child is able to manage himself/herself emotionally.
