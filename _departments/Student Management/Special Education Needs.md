### SEN

_“You were born with wings, why prefer to crawl through life.”- Rumi_

  

Welcome to SBPS SEN Webpage!

  

At SBPS, we continue to support our students who have experience learning or behavioural need difficulties to thrive in their academic, co-curriculum activities, as well as their character development.

**What are Special Educational Needs (SEN)?**

  

A student who has special educational needs may experience learning or/and behavioural difficulties that are greater than the majority of children of the same age. For examples, difficulties in social context, language, academic or physical abilities.

  

The student may have difficulties:

  

*   Doing school work
*   Reading and writing
*   Communicating with others
*   Making friends
*   Behaving appropriately in the presence of others
*   Learning in school due to limitations in sight, hearing or physical mobility

  

Each student is different. Two students with the same diagnosis may be very different in terms of learning and support needs, and may progress at a different pace.

  

**What do we do?** 

At SBPS, we have specialized personnel and programmes to provide the following special support catering to different levels and learning needs:

  

*   **Learning and behaviour support**  provided by Special Educational Needs Officer (SEN Officer) and Teacher Trained in Special Needs (TSN). This is in the form of individual or small group intervention or skills training, or in-class support for approximately 30 to 60 minutes per week.
*   **Teachers trained in special needs** provide learning support and share strategies with other teachers in school.
*   **Learning support programme** for Primary 1 and Primary 2 students who need additional help with English Language or Mathematics. 
*   **School-based dyslexia remediation programme** for students with dyslexia in Primary 3 and Primary 4. Students with dyslexia in other levels will have access to the Main Literacy Programme conducted by the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS).
*   **Access to REACH** , a community health service to support social or behavioural difficulties.
