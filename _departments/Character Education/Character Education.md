### Character Education

Quality relationships are a core and basic need that is necessary for all our students. Every child has a need to feel secure, welcomed, empowered, and capable, which can be achieved in our students through strong student relationships. Positive peer relationships make it easier to provide care, promote resilience, and give students a sense of belonging.

In Sembawang Primary School, we adopt the the PSR Framework which embodies the 3 domains of:

●      Peer Helping

●      Peer Bonding

●       Peer Influencing

    **Level 1 - Every Child is a Peer Supporter**

The students are taught that every student can play the role of a peer supporter - by understanding that everyone is different and each of them should appreciate the unique personality of each other.

Through multiple programs in school, students are taught how to be a good friend to their peers and show care for each other.

Additionally, every student in Sembawang Primary School will be paired to at least 1 **_Peer Buddy,_** a fellow student that is either from their form classes or CCA.

The role of the Peer Buddy is to:

●      Keep a look out for one another

●      Check-in on their buddies when they have been away from school.

1.  **Selected students trained to be Peer Support Leaders**

In each class, teachers will select suitable students to receive further training on how to be a SBPS PAL (Peer Support Leader).

Kindly refer to  [SBPS PAL (Peer Support Leader)](https://sembawangpri.moe.edu.sg/programmes/learning-for-life-programme/sbps-pal-peer-support-leader) for more information on the training program.

**Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**

In ECG, students are guided to make informed school choices based on their values, strengths, interests and skills through secondary school talks, career talks and experiences that provide opportunities to build students’ self-awareness and knowledge of the different education and career pathways. ECG aims to:

●      Nurture students' self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning

●      Enable students to explore education and career options

●      Help students develop a growth mindset and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities

●      Create opportunities for students to develop an appreciation for different career pathways.

In 2022, we have organised our inaugural ECG Seminar for P6 students to:

●  To learn and appreciate the different careers, understanding the joys and challenges that each profession faces

●      Develop a resilient attitude and growth mindset to embrace future challenges.

The students were able to listen and interact with industry professionals from different fields of work, while engaging in question & answer sessions with the speakers. The speakers came from an array of careers, which includes:

●      Statutory Board (Government Agencies)

●      Research and Study

●      Aviation

●       Medical

**Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)**

CCE (FTGP) lessons involve the explicit teaching and learning of fundamental social-emotional skills which are anchored on values and citizenship dispositions. The activities, reflections and discussions during the lessons also help strengthen positive Teacher-Student Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships.

The following six CCE content areas will be explored and discussed in a developmentally appropriate manner during the CCE (FTGP) lessons:

●       Cyber Wellness

●       Education and Career Guidance

●       Family Education

●       Mental Health

●       National Education

●       Growing Years Programme

**CCE (Mother Tongue Language)**

CCE (MTL) lessons are taught in the Mother Tongue Languages as they hold rich sources of knowledge for the transmission of values. This will also increase the amount of language exposure time to enhance their learning of Chinese, Malay and Tamil.

Cultural stories, poems, songs and proverbs unique to each MTL are selected to support the teaching and learning of values in CCE (MTL). During CCE (MTL) lessons, students will have the opportunities to discuss and internalise the values learnt.

For students who are exempted from MTL, they will have CCE Lessons in the English medium during CCE (MTL) periods. Instructional materials in EL have been developed to cater to this group of students.

**In-class Library: Values-based Storybooks**

Through stories and story-telling, students are encouraged to explore their thoughts and feelings. In the process, students learn to respect different perspectives and learn to embrace diversity. The provision of values-based storybooks in the class library (P1 - P2) aims to inculcate values in students by developing their reflective thinking skills as they articulate how they can apply moral values in their daily lives.

Stories linked to curriculum topics and school values were introduced to students through a story-telling approach. Students engaged in class discussions and peer sharing to share their views and provide alternate perspectives for different scenarios.

**SBPS Star**

SBPS Star is a school-based recognition for students who have demonstrated exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities, and are role models to their peers. Every semester, form teachers can nominate up to 2 students to be SBPS Stars of the class. SBPS Stars will be awarded with a certificate of recognition and a collar pin which they can wear on their uniform for the year.
