### Programme for Active Learning
At Primary 1 and 2 levels, PAL provides opportunities for students to discover new interests, develop character and enable them to cultivate social-emotional competencies. Designed by our school’s PE, Art and Music specialised teachers, PAL lessons offer hands-on and experiential learning through the domains of:

●       Sports and Games

●       Outdoor Education

●       Visual Arts

●       Performing Arts

During PAL lessons, students have the opportunities to engage in experimentation, exploration, interaction with peers and to achieve success via meaningfully designed activities. These are the characteristics of PAL lessons:

●       Focus on Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and values

●       Driven by experiential learning

●       Encompass learning in creative ways

●       Provide opportunities to create

●       Engage in fun and enjoyable learning

Outdoor Education - Plant-Potting

  

_Students learnt to pot plants and handle them with care. Our students’ specially designed pots of plants and cards were delivered to the elderly at Woodlands Care Centre and Sree Narayana Mission (Singapore). As part of their Values in Action (VIA) experience, students learnt that even at a young age, they can contribute meaningfully to the community too._
