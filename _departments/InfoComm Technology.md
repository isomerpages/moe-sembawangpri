<h3>ICT</h3>
<p>ICT is a key enabler in students’ learning. To develop students’ Digital
Literacy, students are equipped with a range of Digital Competencies, through
ICT programmes such as Code@SBPS and Baseline ICT skills training, as well
as integration of EdTech tools into lessons. This is undergirded by Cyber
Wellness education addressing contemporary issues, ensuring their safe
and responsible use of ICT.</p>

<p><strong>2) Code @ SBPS</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with the national focus to equip students with digital literacy,
the school aims to provide all students with exposure to coding to develop
their computational thinking skills. Code@SBPS is structured to provide
all Primary 3 to Primary 6 students exposure to block programming, with
each level’s coding program building on what students had learnt in the
previous year.</p>

<p><strong>3) New Media Literacies (Baseline ICT skills) Training</strong>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>The Baseline ICT Standard and New Media Literacies (NML) is a set of ICT
and literacy skills that are infused into our curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Baseline ICT training provides the basic level of knowledge and skills
that our students need to help them apply and demonstrate when harnessing
technologies for learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our students are taught how to apply digital tools to locate and organise
information (Curate), how to use digital creation tools and applications
to create digital artifacts (Create) and how to use digital communication
tools to communicate ideas with peers and share information (Connect).</p>
