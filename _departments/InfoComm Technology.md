### ICT
ICT is a key enabler in students’ learning. To develop students’ Digital Literacy, students are equipped with a range of Digital Competencies, through ICT programmes such as Code@SBPS and Baseline ICT skills training, as well as integration of EdTech tools into lessons. This is undergirded by Cyber Wellness education addressing contemporary issues, ensuring their safe and responsible use of ICT.

**1)&nbsp;Cyber Wellness**  
  

Through Cyber Wellness education in CCE, students learn to be respectful, safe, and responsible users of technology and be a positive peer influence, advocating for the good of the community online.

These are the key messages which students will understand:

1.) Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities.

2.) Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence.

3.) Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace.




**2) Code @ SBPS**  
  

In line with the national focus to equip students with digital literacy to thrive in an increasingly digitalised world, the school aims to expose all students to coding, to develop their computational thinking skills. Code@SBPS is structured to expose Primary 3 to Primary 6 students to block programming yearly. It is a spiral curriculum which revisits and builds on what students have learnt previously.
