<h3>ICT</h3>
<p>At Sembawang Primary School, the Infocomm Technology (ICT) Department
is committed to nurturing future-ready learners by equipping them with
a wide range of digital competencies, including coding and computational
thinking.</p>
<p>This is achieved through programmes such as Computational Thinking @ SBPS
and ICT Basics, as well as the integration of educational technology tools
into daily lessons. These efforts aim to build students’ confidence and
capability in using technology meaningfully for learning, communication,
and problem-solving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Computational Thinking @ SBPS</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme is thoughtfully designed to provide all Primary 3 to Primary
6 students with essential computational thinking concepts such as sequencing,
loops, and conditionals.
<br>These are introduced through a combination of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Unplugged activities (technology-free learning tasks)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hands-on coding experiences</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The programme strengthens students’ logical thinking and problem-solving
abilities, laying a strong foundation for digital literacy and lifelong
learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ICT Basics</strong>
</p>
<p>ICT Basics equips students with the foundational knowledge and practical
skills required to use technology confidently and effectively.
<br>The key areas of focus include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Basic operations of computing devices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Touch typing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of word processing tools (e.g., Microsoft Word)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These essential skills enable students to apply digital tools meaningfully
in both their academic tasks and everyday digital interactions.</p>
