<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p>A strong foundation in numeracy is important as mathematical skills are
critical to many of our everyday activities. Furthermore, with Science
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) as the main driver of emerging
job markets, our students need to have strong mathematical skills to be
able to access the opportunities, which will become available in the years
head.</p>
<p>Students’ passion in a subject do influence their motivation to learn
and achieve mastery. Thus, our focus is on developing students’ problem
solving skills in a fun and meaningful way. The department programmes follow
closely to the direction set by MOE. The programmes enable students to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and
continuous learning in mathematics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive
skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build confidence and foster joy of learning in mathematics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Mathematics curriculum, the department administers
the following programmes to help all students achieve success in learning
mathematics.</p>

<p>Primary 1 to 4 students who require more help to catch up with their peers
receive coaching on basic numeracy concepts and skills through the Learning
Support for Mathematics (LSM) programme.</p>
<p>Students in the LSM programme benefit from small class size and thus more
individual attention from the teacher. They also learn through specially
designed activities to build their confidence in Mathematics.</p>

<p>ICAN pedagogy aims to raise the confidence and achievement of students
who are not performing well in Mathematics.</p>
<p>Through ICAN, teachers identify students’ main learning challenges, help
them close their learning gaps, and scaffold the learning of new knowledge
and skills. Lessons are structured to allow students to appreciate how
Mathematics can be applied to everyday life. Students are also given opportunities
to experience incremental success which enable them to develop more confidence
in themselves and find Mathematics more enjoyable over time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>E2K Mathematics Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme was conceptualized as a Mathematics enrichment
programme for selected students who demonstrate interest and high ability
in Mathematics.</p>
<p>The programme aims to foster independence in mathematical thinking skills,
as well as nurture 21st century competencies such as resilience, resourcefulness
to enhance critical and inventive thinking as well as effective communication
skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the E2K sessions, students will be exposed to challenging Math
problems. The learning experiences will include opportunities to discover,
reason and communicate mathematical ideas and concepts, especially in problem
solving.</p>

<p>Financial literacy complements the teaching of consumer mathematics concepts
by providing a real-world context for the students to make sense of quantities
and to reason inductively about data. It provides a platform for students
to apply mathematics in everyday decision making, beyond merely finding
the “correct” answers.</p>
<p>Through the Financial Literacy programme, authentic applications of money
decisions are integrated into the mathematics curriculum topics of money,
graphs, fraction and percentage. Through these lessons, students also gain
basic knowledge on economics and financial management skills.</p>

<p>Research shows that families are an essential part of the learning of
Mathematics. Doing and supporting mathematics learning at home can make
a great difference in a child’s mathematics learning. When children participate
in the activities with family members, their self-confidence increases
and their attitude towards mathematics improves.</p>
<p>The Math Homekit has been designed to provide opportunities for parents
and their children to solve problems using logical thinking. Students will
develop strategies and communicate mathematical thinking and understanding.
Some questions in the The Math Homekit booklet can be used by parents to
help their children gain a clearer understanding of the mathematics concepts.
While some of the activities review concepts that have already been taught
in class, some activities will help to extend the students’ understanding
and prepare them for math concepts to be explored in class.</p>
