### Music

Music Education in Sembawang Primary School aims to develop basic musicianship in all students through listening, creating and performing music. At the end of the 6 years of music education, students will develop:  
  
• An awareness and appreciation in music  
• Ability to express themselves creatively and communicate through music  
• An interest and desire for life-long learning in music  
  
Our music lessons also offer a natural platform for the development of 21st century competencies (e.g. values such as respect, care, harmony and integrity are essential for playing in an ensemble or working on an art project in teams). Students will develop:  
  
• Collaborative skills through project work and ensemble performance  
• Critical thinking and inventive thinking through creative tasks  
• Self-confidence and self-esteem through showcasing and encouraging students’ voice  
• Self-directedness through interest-driven, exploratory and experiential learning
