### Science

**Introduction**  
  
Science helps us to make sense of natural phenomena in the world that we live in. With basic Science literacy, students would be equipped with the necessary knowledge to navigate everyday life. Practising scientific inquiry also develops students’ ability to ask questions about the world around them, make sense of data, and arrive at logical deductions and conclusions.

Our department envisions that **every child is a scientific thinker** who:

*   Is **curious** about the world around them;
*   Is able to **apply inquiry skills** in everyday life (e.g. identify questions, analyse data, draw evidence-based conclusions);
*   Is able to **make informed decisions** relating to Science and technology; and 
*   Is **compassionate towards other living things** and **cares for the environment** .

All young children are innately curious about the world around them. Our goal is to tap on this curiosity to develop in our students the skills of inquiry and problem-solving which they can apply in authentic, every-day situations through experiential learning opportunities.

**Field-based Learning via Learning Journeys**  
  
Students from P3 to P6 enjoy opportunities to attend learning journeys for rich field-based learning on identified Science topics:

| Level | Learning Journey | Topic |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Primary 3 | Guided Tour at Singapore Botanic Gardens | Diversity of Plants |
| Primary 5 | Diversity of Cells Workshop at Science Centre Singapore | The Unit of Life |
| Primary 6 | Adaptations Workshop and Guided Tour at Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum | Adaptations, Man’s Impact on the Environment |

**E2K Science Programme**  

The E2K Science Programme is an enrichment programme for Upper Primary students who demonstrate interest and ability in Science. It aims to foster independence and confidence in scientific inquiry, as well as develop Science process skills and 21st century competencies such as resilience, resourcefulness, communications skills, and critical and inventive thinking.

During the weekly sessions, stories, role-play and challenges are used to replicate the process that scientists go through to generate knowledge in Science. Students will be engaged in higher order thinking through effective questioning and experimentation that will allow them to discover scientific principles inductively.
