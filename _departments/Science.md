<h3>Science</h3>
<p>At Sembawang Primary School, we believe Science education is fundamental
in helping our students understand and appreciate the world around them.
Through our STEM education programme, students develop essential scientific
literacy that enables them to make sense of everyday phenomena and make
informed decisions in their daily lives. Our approach to teaching Science
aligns with Singapore's Science Curriculum Framework, providing students
with a strong fundamental in Science for life, learning, citizenry and
work.</p>

<p>Our department's vision is to nurture every child into a scientific thinker
who:</p>
<p>• Demonstrates natural curiosity about the world around them</p>
<p>• Understands and applies scientific concepts to real-life situations</p>
<p>• Engages confidently in the Practices of Science (such as questioning,
data analysis and evidence-based reasoning)</p>
<p>• Appreciates the impact of Science on people and the environment</p>
<p>We recognise that children are naturally inquisitive about their surroundings.
Our STEM education programme aims to harness this innate curiosity, developing
crucial inquiry and problem-solving skills through hands-on, experiential
learning opportunities that reflect real-world situations.</p>

<p><strong><u>Learning Beyond the Classroom</u></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that some of the most valuable learning experiences happen
outside traditional classroom settings. Our students participate in experiential
activities such as exploring our school's Green Trail to study plant and
animal diversity, and engaging in interactive, cross-disciplinary learning
journeys that bring Science concepts to life.</p>

<p><strong>E2K Science Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Science Programme is an enrichment programme for Upper Primary
students who demonstrate interest and ability in Science. It aims to foster
independence and confidence in scientific inquiry, as well as develop Science
process skills and 21st century competencies such as resilience, resourcefulness,
communications skills, and critical and inventive thinking.</p>
<p>During the weekly sessions, stories, role-play and challenges are used
to replicate the process that scientists go through to generate knowledge
in Science. Students will be engaged in higher order thinking through effective
questioning and experimentation that will allow them to discover scientific
principles inductively.&nbsp;</p>
