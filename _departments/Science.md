<h3>Science</h3>
<p>At Sembawang Primary School, we believe Science education is fundamental
in helping our students understand and appreciate the world around them.
Through our STEM education programme, students develop essential scientific
literacy that enables them to make sense of everyday phenomena and make
informed decisions in their daily lives. Our approach to teaching Science
aligns with Singapore's Science Curriculum Framework, providing students
with a strong fundamental in Science for life, learning, citizenry and
work.</p>

<p><strong>E2K Science Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Science Programme is an enrichment programme for Upper Primary
students who demonstrate interest and ability in Science. It aims to foster
independence and confidence in scientific inquiry, as well as develop Science
process skills and 21st century competencies such as resilience, resourcefulness,
communications skills, and critical and inventive thinking.</p>
<p>During the weekly sessions, stories, role-play and challenges are used
to replicate the process that scientists go through to generate knowledge
in Science. Students will be engaged in higher order thinking through effective
questioning and experimentation that will allow them to discover scientific
principles inductively.&nbsp;</p>
