### Physical Education

The PE department believes in the holistic development of a child to enable them to engage in recreational physical activities. We provide opportunities and platforms for students to build a strong foundation in terms of physical skills and games concepts. Values such as resilience and responsibility are also inculcated through PE lessons and other events/programmes.
