<p><strong>Student Management Department</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Guiding Principles</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Sembawang Primary School, we are committed to fostering a <strong>Safe, Conducive and Inclusive learning environment for all students.</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that effective learning flourishes when students demonstrate
positive behaviour and build meaningful relationships with their peers.
These relationships are anchored in our core school values of <strong>Care, Gratitude and Integrity</strong>,
which guide our students in their daily interactions and personal growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Discipline in SBPS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Student Management Department embraces a positive, whole-school approach
to discipline. We believe that:</p>
<p>• Students thrive in an orderly environment, whilst needing support and
space to learn from mistakes</p>
<p>• Discipline is an educational journey that builds self-discipline and
shapes character</p>
<p>• Consequences for poor choices must be fair, firm and appropriate, serving
as learning opportunities rather than punishment</p>

<p><strong><u>Support for Students</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Sembawang Primary School, we champion inclusive education, recognising
that each student has unique needs and challenges.</p>
<p>We understand that each child's journey is unique - even students with
similar diagnoses may have different learning needs and progress at their
own pace. We provide specialised support through dedicated personnel and
tailored programmes. Our counselling team provides professional support
for students' emotional well-being and personal development. We work closely
with parents to implement targeted interventions that enhance students'
social and emotional growth.</p>
