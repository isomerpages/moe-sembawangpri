<p><strong>Student Management Department</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Guiding Principles</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Sembawang Primary School, we are committed to fostering a <strong>Safe, Conducive and Inclusive learning environment for all students.</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe that effective learning flourishes when students demonstrate
positive behaviour and build meaningful relationships with their peers.
These relationships are anchored in our core school values of <strong>Care, Gratitude and Integrity</strong>,
which guide our students in their daily interactions and personal growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Discipline in SBPS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Student Management Department embraces a positive, whole-school approach
to discipline. We believe that:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stude​nts learn well
when there is order and discipline. At the same time, they need care, encouragement,
and space to learn from mistakes and improve.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discipline is an educative
process, and the goal is to instil self-discipline and good character in
students.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disciplinary measures
serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor choices made. It is not punishment,
and must be meted out fairly, firmly, and appropriately.</p>

<p><strong><u>Support for Students</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school believes in the provision of an inclusive education system
with opportunities for all, recognizing that our students have different
needs and a plethora of needs or issues that they face.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students with SEN</strong>
</p>
<p>The student may have learning and behavioural difficulties, compared to
their peers in the respective areas:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Completion of schoolwork</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading and writing</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicating with others</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making friends</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behaving appropriately
in the presence of others</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learning in school due
to limitations in sight, hearing, or physical mobility</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TRANSIT Program for
Primary 1 students</p>
<p>We believe that every child is different. Two students with the same diagnosis
may be very different in terms of learning and support needs and may progress
at a different pace.</p>
<p>At Sembawang Primary SChool, we have specialized personnel and programmes
to provide the following special support catering to different levels and
learning needs.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counselling</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school counselling team will seek to engage and support students with
emotional difficulties, enabling them to make positive changes in their
personal development.</p>
<p>Together with the partnership of parents, planned and targeted intervention
will be implemented for the students in the domain of social emotional
development.</p>
