Emergency Preparedness Culture -&nbsp;**Have a MINDSET of preparedness, ready to act!**

**School Safety &amp; Security Approach**

  

The safety and security of our students and staff are of paramount importance to us.&nbsp; Working in partnership with our parents and stakeholders, we adopt a whole school approach in the creation of a safe and secure learning environment.  

  

**School Visitors**&nbsp;

All visitors (including parents/guardians) are required to enter the school via the main gate and report to the security guard post for registration. All visitors must then report to the General Office to seek assistance. Visitors are&nbsp;&nbsp;**not allowed**&nbsp;&nbsp;to proceed beyond the General Office without an accompanying school staff or informing the staff at the General Office of their intention, for instance to make purchases at the bookstore. The school staff are authorized to approach any visitor, when necessary.

  

  

**School Gates Opening Hours**&nbsp;

  

Before the morning assembly, students may enter the school using either the main&nbsp;gate or one of the side gates. The main gate is open from 6.30 am to 7.00 pm on school&nbsp;days, while the side gates are open for students before morning assembly and during&nbsp;school dismissal time.

**Morning Drop-Off**

Parents who choose to drive to school are encouraged to drop off your child at the access roads next to Blocks 312/313 Sembawang Drive or Blocks 316/317 Sembawang Vista. Alternatively, parents can drop off your child at the MSCP located at Block 313A Sembawang Drive or Block 306B Canberra Road. Students who alight at these locations may enter the school via the side&nbsp;gates.

During the morning reporting period from 6.45am to 7.30am, parents may alight your child at the sheltered foyer of the school concourse. To ensure smooth flow of traffic in the school, we seek parents’ assistance to get&nbsp;your child ready to alight with their school bags upon entering the school gate.  

  

We urge drivers to exhibit patience and care when driving&nbsp;within the school compound. Drivers must keep to the speed limit of&nbsp;**15 km/h**&nbsp;and follow the&nbsp;directions given by our school staff or security guards.  

  

**School Dismissal**&nbsp;

  

Students may be dismissed via the main gate or one of the side gates during school&nbsp;dismissal. We seek parents/guardians’ cooperation to wait at the designated areas along the walkway at the main gate or at the void decks of the HDB flats located near the side gates for their child/ward, so as to avoid congestion at the gates. The School’s main gate is close from 1.15pm to 1.45pm to all vehicles, except for authorized vehicles such as School buses. Parents who are driving into the School to pick up your child can only do so from 1.45pm&nbsp;provided all our school&nbsp;buses have left the school compound.  

  

**Permission to Leave School Early**&nbsp;

  

Students are&nbsp;**not allowed**&nbsp;to leave school on their own during curriculum time. Students&nbsp;who need to leave school before school dismissal must be fetched by either their parents, a&nbsp;member of their family or household helper. Such persons will be required to produce identification(s)/identify themselves or be identified by the student in&nbsp;the presence of a General Office staff before they are allowed to leave with the student.

  

**Safety Around The School**&nbsp;

  

Students are reminded to exercise caution and observe safety in the school. &nbsp;Students are to walk quietly from point to point. Students are not to play or run along the corridor, staircases, on the roads within the school premises, at the concourse and the canteen. Students are to also observe play safety during CCA, PE and Sports lessons. For instance, students must keep fingernails short, and avoid wearing necklace and watch during PE and Sports lessons. Students should also queue up when making purchases at the school canteen and&nbsp;bookshop, and when boarding school buses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  
In the event that the lightning warning system is triggered, students must stop all outdoor activities&nbsp;immediately and move indoors or into sheltered areas.  

  

**Road Safety**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

  

School places high emphasis on road safety. Our students are reminded to always exercise caution and care on the road. School educates our students to always use pedestrian crossings; practise the Kerb Drill when crossing the road; obey traffic&nbsp;signals; avoid crossing in front of stationary vehicle or in-between vehicles as the drivers may not see you; do not run, play or use personal devices (such as mobile phones) when crossing the road; use footpath and walkway instead of walking on the side of the road.  

  

For students who cycle to and from the School, we seek parents/guardians’ co-operation to ensure that your child/ward adhere to the safety regulations by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on cyclists.  

  

  

**Emergency Preparedness**

  

Emergency exercises such as lockdown and fire evacuation drills are held twice a year to familiarize our students and staff on what to do in an emergency.&nbsp; As Minister for Home Affairs once said, it is not a matter of “IF”, but “WHEN”.

  

MOE conducts Temperature Taking Exercise twice a year, typically in January and July period. This is primarily aimed at maintaining&nbsp;schools' preparedness to re-activate the temperature-taking regime should there be a need to.&nbsp;Parents/guardians are requested to ensure that your child/ward possesses a serviceable personal Oral Digital Thermometer (ODT) for use at all times of the year and not only for Temperature Taking Exercises.

**Update of Particulars**&nbsp;Parents/guardians are reminded to provide up-to-date (1) health declaration of your child, (2) addresses and (3) contact details of parents/guardians to the school. For students who commute daily from Malaysia, parents/guardians are reminded to provide up-to-date local and foreign contact addresses and contact details (contact number and person), to facilitate link up during emergency situations.

  

**Travel Declaration**

As part of emergency management and in ensuring our&nbsp;school continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, students who travel out of Singapore during the school holidays&nbsp;are required to submit their Travel Declaration. Given the transition to primary school environment, Parents of all P1 students are to declare the travel plans of your child, regardless of travel intent, unless advised otherwise. Parents of other levels are to declare the travel plans&nbsp;ONLY&nbsp;if your child intend to travel. Parents/guardians may submit your child’s travel&nbsp;declaration via the&nbsp;Parents Gateway.&nbsp;If there is a change of travel plan(s) after declaration, please submit a new travel declaration for the updated travel destination via PG or inform the school for cancellation of travel plan(s).&nbsp;The hardcopy form for&nbsp;parents without internet or PG access is also available upon request.
