The exterior facades of the school are the ‘faces’ that greet our students, visitors and pedestrians along the school fencelines. It is also important that the colours representation commensurate and strengthen the identity of the school which our staff and students can be proud of and the public can associate with. Armed with these considerations and the school’s mission of “Nurturing Innovators in a Vibrant Community”, the exterior facades of the school buildings are decorated in bold and vibrant colours of BLUE, YELLOW and RED, accentuated by thick BLACK lines on a GRAY TINT colour backdrop. The school’s paint scheme was founded on the **Blue and Yellow colours of the School Crest** and the work of a famous Dutch artist named Piet Mondrian. Piet Mondrian created the definitive abstract paintings using White, Black, Gray , and the three Primary Colours of **Red, Yellow and Blue** , with the composition constructed from **thick Black horizontal and vertical lines** that delineated the outlines of the various rectangles of colours. The transformation was completed in Mar 2019 and we hope the school buildings would inject vibrancy to the surroundings as well. Come and experience it yourself!
