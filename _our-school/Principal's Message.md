<p>Welcome to Sembawang Primary School!</p>
<p>In 2024, we reviewed our school's strategic directions and goals, incorporating
feedback from staff, students and parents, and aligning with MOE's key
direction to prepare students for the future of learning.</p>
<p>Our revised vision, "<strong><em>Future-Ready Learners, Rooted in Values</em></strong>",
is the cornerstone of our educational approach. We aim to nurture reflective
contributors and compassionate leaders who are confident, self-directed,
and able to thrive in a rapidly changing, interconnected world. Our students
are grounded in our school values: care, gratitude, integrity, curiosity,
excellence and resilience.</p>
<p>Our revised mission, "<strong><em>Nurturing Future-Ready Learners in a Vibrant Community</em></strong>",
reflects our commitment to holistic education through a dynamic and enabling
environment. Our motto, "The Best from Me", embodies our belief in empowering
each student to strive for excellence and contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
<p>We bring these to life through innovative teaching methods, a rich curriculum,
and diverse co-curricular activities. Our dedicated educators employ student-centric
approaches, leveraging technology and real-world experiences to cultivate
critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration skills. We also emphasise
character development and values education, ensuring our students are well-prepared
for the challenges and opportunities of the future</p>
<p>In Sembawang Primary, we provide a holistic education that fosters the
joy of learning in a safe, caring environment. We nurture the whole child,
ensuring every student thrives academically, socially and emotionally.
Our focus remains on developing student agency, empowering learners to
take ownership of their journey and cultivate independence, responsibility
and initiative.</p>
<p>We invite you to explore our website to discover our programmes, initiatives
and student achievements. Together, let's build a community where every
student is inspired to reach their full potential and make a positive impact
on the world.</p>
<p>Yours in education,</p>
<p>Mr Ng Aik Boon</p>
