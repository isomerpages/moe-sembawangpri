Dear Parents and Students,

Welcome to Sembawang Primary School. We are dedicated to creating a nurturing learning environment that cultivates innovative thinkers and instills strong values in our students.

Our vision of "Innovative Learners, Rooted in Values" serves as the foundation of our educational approach. We are committed to nurturing students who excel in critical and creative thinking, while also embodying principles of care, gratitude, integrity, curiosity, excellence, and resilience.

Our mission of "Nurturing Innovators in a Vibrant Community" underscores our dedication to providing a dynamic and inclusive space for our students to explore, innovate, and collaborate. The motto "The Best from Me" encapsulates our belief in empowering each student to strive for excellence and contribute their best to the community.

At Sembawang Primary, we are guided by the philosophy of providing a holistic education that fosters the joy of learning in a safe and caring environment. We believe in nurturing the whole child, ensuring that every student has the opportunity to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.

This year, our focus will be on continuing to develop student agency. We want to empower our students to take ownership of their learning journey, fostering independence, and instilling a sense of responsibility and initiative. Together, let us continue to build a community where every student can reach their full potential and contribute positively to the world.

Yours in education,

Mr. Ng Aik Boon
