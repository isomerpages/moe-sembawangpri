Learning is an adventure.

Learning is fun.

One caring happy family;

This is Sembawang; Oh, Sembawang;

A place for everyone.

 

 Let's be our best.

Let's do our best

To realize our vision, achieve our goals;

Creating a bright future for one and all;

Building a caring learning community;

Together, serving nation and humanity.

 

 Learning is an adventure.

Learning is fun.

One caring happy family;

This is Sembawang; Oh, Sembawang;

A place for everyone.


Lyrics -  Han Mok Puek

Music -  Tan Wei Ling
