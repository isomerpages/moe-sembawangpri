<p><strong><u>Use of Electronic Devices</u></strong>
</p>
<p>• Students who bring such devices are to put them in their school bags
before school start time. Note: Except for POSB Smart Buddy watch.</p>
<p>• Devices are to be switched off at all times. Students are not to use
smartphones and smartwatches during school hours including recess, lunch,
CCA and after-school programmes (e.g. supplementary/ enrichment/ remedial
lessons).</p>
<p>• Students should bear responsibility for safekeeping of devices, and
the school will not be held responsible for any loss or damage (e.g. supplementary/
enrichment/ remedial lessons &amp; learning journeys).</p>
<p>• If students need to contact their parents/ guardians, they may use the
phone located within the General Office.</p>
<p>• Any students found using their devices irresponsibly within the school
compound will have the device confiscated without exception. Confiscated
smartphones or smartwatches can only be retrieved by the student's parents.</p>
<p>Discipline is fundamental to character development and a safe learning
environment. The success of our students' journey depends greatly on the
strong partnership between school and home. The school value parents and
guardians as key partners and look forward to working closely to support
your child's development.</p>
