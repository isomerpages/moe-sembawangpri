Emergency Preparedness Culture - **Have a MINDSET of preparedness, ready to act!**

**School Safety & Security Approach**

  

The safety and security of our students and staff are of paramount importance to us.  Working in partnership with our parents and stakeholders, we adopt a whole school approach in the creation of a safe and secure learning environment.  

  

**School Visitors** 

All visitors (including parents/guardians) are required to enter the school via the main gate and report to the security guard post for screening and registration. All visitors must then report to the General Office to seek assistance. Visitors are  **not allowed**  to proceed beyond the General Office without an accompanying school staff. The school staff are authorized to approach any visitor, when necessary.

  

  

**School Gates Opening Hours** 

  

Before the morning assembly, students may enter the school using either the main gate or one of the side gates. The main gate is open from 6.30 am to 7.00 pm on school days, while the side gates are open for students before morning assembly and during school dismissal time.
