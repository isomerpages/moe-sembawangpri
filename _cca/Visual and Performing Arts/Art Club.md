#### **OUR OBJECTIVE**

  

The Art Club aspires to create budding artists who are passionate about art.

  

#### **WHAT WE DO**

  

Students learn different art styles, create various artefacts and get introduced to many different artists and art mediums. They go on museum visits, join art competitions and also play a part in making the school beautiful by displaying their artworks.

  

#### **OUR ACHIEVEMENTS**

**1\. SYF 2019**  
  

Sembawang Primary School took part in the 2019 SYF (Singapore Youth Festival) Competition. Our artwork (MY SG KIT) was selected by the curators for the on-site exhibition at the National Art Museum.It was one of the number of artworks which demonstrated creative interpretation of the theme for the exhibition and our school was conferred the Certificate of Recognition (Special Mention).&nbsp;

  
Our budding artists on their artwork (My SG Kit)  
  
&nbsp;**• What?**  
  
We want to show Singapore’s multicultural society and our beautiful landmarks in the form of a model kit.  
  
&nbsp;**• Why?**  

Every part you see here is an important part of the Singapore identity, just like a model kit. In a model kit, every part is integral to the construction of the whole model and to us, Singapore is that model country celebrating racial diversity and sharing each other’s customs and cultures.&nbsp;

  
**• How?**  
  

We brainstormed on what constitutes Singapore and what it means to be a Singaporean. So we came up with the iconic landmarks that represents Singapore to the whole world. And as Mr Lee Kuan Yew once said,”Singapore is not a Malay nation, not a Chinese nation, not an Indian nation. Everyone will have a place in Singapore.”&nbsp;

  

We used coloured pencils and markers and a variety of mixed media like paper, cardboards, styrofoam and other recycled materials.
