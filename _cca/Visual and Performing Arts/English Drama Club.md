##### Canberra Community Club Easter Celebration 2022

<p align="justify">Our Drama Club participated in the Easter Celebration 2022 organised by Canberra Zone 3 and acted a story called ‘The Giving Tree’. The story begins with a young boy who discovers his friendship with a tree. They play, care and share with each other. But time and age gets in the way as a growing boy grows distant. His wants and desires are no longer what they once were as a boy. Playful antics have been replaced by material wants. All of which, the tree tries her best to provide. Time passes till he's but an old man who only wants a place to rest. They share a space of friendship and are happy again.</p>
