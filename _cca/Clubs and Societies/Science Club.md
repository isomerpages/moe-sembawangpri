<h3>Science Club</h3>
<p>The Science &amp; Green Club gives students a fun and hands-on way to
explore nature and learn how to care for the environment. Members go on
nature walks, record their observations in journals, and take part in exciting
projects like bird and butterfly watching. They also upload their sightings
on iNaturalist to contribute to real scientific research. Through these
activities, students develop a love for nature, learn important science
skills, and are encouraged to take action to protect the Earth and support
green efforts in school and at home.</p>

<p>We explored our neighbourhood to learn more about litter and its impact
on our environment. With guidance by facilitators from Stridy, we identified
common types of litter and discovered how simple actions, like picking
up trash, can help protect nature and keep our shared spaces clean.</p>
