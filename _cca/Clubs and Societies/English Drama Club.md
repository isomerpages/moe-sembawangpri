<h5>Canberra Community Club Easter Celebration 2022</h5>
<p>Our Drama Club participated in the Easter Celebration 2022 organised by
Canberra Zone 3 and acted a story called ‘The Giving Tree’. The story begins
with a young boy who discovers his friendship with a tree. They play, care
and share with each other. But time and age gets in the way as a growing
boy grows distant. His wants and desires are no longer what they once were
as a boy. Playful antics have been replaced by material wants. All of which,
the tree tries her best to provide. Time passes till he's but an old man
who only wants a place to rest. They share a space of friendship and are
happy again.</p>
