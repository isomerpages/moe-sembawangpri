<h3>Softball</h3>
<p>Softball is the only all-girls CCA offered in Sembawang Primary School
(SBPS). The CCA provides the perfect opportunity for pupils to home in
fundamental skills such as throwing and catching, batting and running into
opponent’s base to eventually win points when they reach the home plate.
Softball requires critical decision-making skills which students will learn
when they must either run into bases or defend their bases.</p>
<p>Softball cultivates important values such as unity, teamwork, resilience,
and sportsmanship. There is a strong camaraderie in the team, and everybody
helps one another to make the CCA engaging and rich.</p>
<p>In SBPS, the CCA has 43 students, from P3-6. They will represent the U-10
(Junior Division) and U-12 (Senior Division). Training sessions take place
twice a week and they get more intensive prior to the National Games competitions
(there will be extra training sessions and friendlies). This year, our
Senior girls emerged 6th in placement. They worked very hard, encouraging
one another and the support was evident when everyone cheered their teammates
on during training and competitions.</p>
<p>Recruitment drive begins in Primary 2 and selected students will undergo
try-outs before joining the team. If you are committed, resilient, love
working in teams and willing to give it your all, softball is the perfect
CCA for you. No prior knowledge is required as training will begin from
the basics. You will find supportive teachers, coaches and teammates doing
their best to help you develop to the best softballer that you can be.</p>
