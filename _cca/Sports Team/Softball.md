### Softball
Softball is the only all-girls CCA offered in Sembawang Primary School (SBPS). The CCA provides the perfect opportunity for pupils to home in fundamental skills such as throwing and catching, batting and running into opponent’s base to eventually win points when they reach the home plate. Softball requires critical decision-making skills which students will learn when they must either run into bases or defend their bases.

Softball cultivates important values such as unity, teamwork, resilience, and sportsmanship. There is a strong camaraderie in the team, and everybody helps one another to make the CCA engaging and rich.

In SBPS, the CCA has 43 students, from P3-6. They will represent the U-10 (Junior Division) and U-12 (Senior Division). Training sessions take place twice a week and they get more intensive prior to the National Games competitions (there will be extra training sessions and friendlies). This year, our Senior girls emerged 6th in placement. They worked very hard, encouraging one another and the support was evident when everyone cheered their teammates on during training and competitions.

Recruitment drive begins in Primary 2 and selected students will undergo try-outs before joining the team. If you are committed, resilient, love working in teams and willing to give it your all, softball is the perfect CCA for you. No prior knowledge is required as training will begin from the basics. You will find supportive teachers, coaches and teammates doing their best to help you develop to the best softballer that you can be.
