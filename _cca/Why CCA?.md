Co-curricular activities (CCAs) are an integral part of your childâ€™s learning experience in their schooling life as they provide your child learning opportunities and platforms to develop social-emotional competencies, on top of skills and knowledge related to the CCA. Furthermore, they provide opportunities for your child to hone his/her leadership skills. Through CCA, your child will receive a well-rounded and holistic education to assist them in their life journey.

**CCA Change**

We understand that your child is in an exploration phase and sometimes their interests may change. If your child wishes to change his/her CCA, kindly apply for CCA change during the CCA change window for higher chances of success. We seek your understanding that CCA change request is dependent on CCA availability.
