**General.** While the school has stepped down on SMMs in line with the national posture, the school will continue to stay vigilant and emphasize the importance of personal hygiene and social responsibility. Parents are advised not to send your child to the school should your child is unwell, instead to seek medical attention if necessary.

**Mask-Wearing.** While mask-wearing in the school setting is not required, it is still an effective way to minimise the risk of infectious disease transmission. Staff and students who prefer to continue wearing masks are allowed to do so.

**Management of COVID+ Cases.**  Students who test positive through COVID testing (i.e. PCR+/Ag+) are only allowed to return to school if they no longer test positive. School will seek photo-proof of negative test result, when necessary.

**Management of Unwell students.**  Students who report to school and display flu-like symptoms will be brought to the sick bay and be sent home upon confirmation of the flu-like symptoms.**

 
**Physical Education**

Students who have gone for a vaccination dose or have COVID-19 infection within the past two weeks will be excused from participation in strenuous activity. Students with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection are also advised to avoid strenuous physical activity for 2 weeks after their first positive COVID-19 test (PCR or ART).


**Conclusion**

The safety and well-being of our students and staff are of utmost importance and the school will not spare any effort to ensure that staff and students adhere to all SMMs. The school will review the SMMs in alignment to the National posture in response to the COVID-19 situation, when necessary.
