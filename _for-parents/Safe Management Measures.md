**Hand Sanitizers**

Over and above the hand sanitizers issued to your child, the school has also deployed hand sanitizers at the entry points to the assembly areas (MPH, ISH and sheltered basketball court). Your child is required to apply the hand sanitizer solution when he/she reaches the assembly area before proceeding to the allocated section in the assembly area. The purpose of doing so is to sanitize the hands as your child may come into contact with surfaces along the way to the school. In addition, the school has also deployed sanitizer dispensers at various locations in the school, to facilitate ease of sanitization should your child is unable to perform washing of hands.

  

**Physical Education**

Students who have gone for a vaccination dose or have COVID-19 infection within the past two weeks will be excused from participation in strenuous activity. Students with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection are also advised to avoid strenuous physical activity for 2 weeks after their first positive COVID-19 test (PCR or ART).

  

**Wearing of Mask**

With the latest announcement of SMMs by the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF), the school has resumed more activities for our students, while adhering to the SMMs. On mask wearing, the school has made the decision to wear mask within the school premises, even at outdoor locations such as the centre court. First and most important of all, putting on a mask is still the best protection to ensure the safety of your child as sporadic COVID-19 cases are reported in school. Second, allowing mask-on and mask-off vis-à-vis the indoor and outdoor locations/spaces within the school will require tremendous effort and manpower to ensure safe distancing when the masks are off. Third, the probability of soiling or tearing the mask is very high, given the frequent mask-on/mask-off occasions.  

The school also advocate and enforce personal hygiene and social responsibility, whereby students regularly wash hands with soap and water or sanitize hands before and after activity, including wipe-down of place after use.  

  

**Conclusion**

The safety and well-being of our students and staff are of utmost importance and the school will not spare any effort to ensure that staff and students adhere to all SMMs. The school will review the SMMs in alignment to the National posture in response to the COVID-19 situation, when necessary.
