**Hand Sanitizers**

Over and above the hand sanitizers issued to your child, the school has also deployed hand sanitizers at the entry points to the assembly areas (MPH, ISH and sheltered basketball court). Your child is required to apply the hand sanitizer solution when he/she reaches the assembly area before proceeding to the allocated section in the assembly area. The purpose of doing so is to sanitize the hands as your child may come into contact with surfaces along the way to the school. In addition, the school has also deployed sanitizer dispensers at various locations in the school, to facilitate ease of sanitization should your child is unable to perform washing of hands.

  

**Physical Education**

Physical Education (PE) will be conducted in accordance with the prevailing national guidelines and strict adherence to safe management measures. Students who have gone for vaccination dose or have COVID-19 infection within the past 2 weeks will be excused from the lesson. Students will wear their face mask when moving to the PE venues. Students need not wear masks when engaging in activities such as running, jogging, static exercises, drills for warm-ups, strength and flexibility. Students engaged in PE will keep their mask in a hygienic manner before the start of physical activities (e.g. covered bag / resealable bag). Students who are not participating in the physical activities will continue to wear their mask.

After the physical activities, students will be allowed to cool down and practise good personal hygiene (e.g. sanitizing or washing of hands) before putting on their masks.PE teachers need not wear a mask when they are engaging in physical activities (e.g. leading a workout), and they will follow safe-distancing measures. When the PE teacher is not involved in physical activities, he/she will don a mask as a precautionary measure (e.g. if teacher moves amongst students in a PE class to give instructions). 

PE classes will be conducted in a spacious and well-ventilated area such as the school hall, Indoor Sports Hall, field or outdoor courts. For classes conducted at small, enclosed venues (e.g. health & fitness room, dance studio), mask may be taken off when performing strenuous activity or as part of class requirement but will have to be put on after the completion of such activity and during rest breaks.  

  

**Wearing of Mask**

With the latest announcement of SMMs by the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF), the school has resumed more activities for our students, while adhering to the SMMs. On mask wearing, the school has made the decision to wear mask within the school premises, even at outdoor locations such as the centre court. First and most important of all, putting on a mask is still the best protection to ensure the safety of your child as sporadic COVID-19 cases are reported in school. Second, allowing mask-on and mask-off vis-à-vis the indoor and outdoor locations/spaces within the school will require tremendous effort and manpower to ensure safe distancing when the masks are off. Third, the probability of soiling or tearing the mask is very high, given the frequent mask-on/mask-off occasions.  

The school also advocate and enforce personal hygiene and social responsibility, whereby students regularly wash hands with soap and water or sanitize hands before and after activity, including wipe-down of place after use.  

  

**Conclusion**

The safety and well-being of our students and staff are of utmost importance and the school will not spare any effort to ensure that staff and students adhere to all SMMs. The school will review the SMMs in alignment to the National posture in response to the COVID-19 situation, when necessary.
