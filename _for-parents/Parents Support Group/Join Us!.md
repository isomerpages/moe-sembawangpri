Hi Parents!

Do you want to be a part of SBPS Parent Support Group family!

You can play an important role in providing the pupils in Sembawang Primary School with a holistic education. Forge a strong working relationship with the school by being in this dynamic PSG Team!  
  

Please watch the video below where our dedicated PSG members work hand-in-hand with the school staff during the various school recesses and other school events and learn their invaluable experiences.
