Parents, being key stakeholders, are an important link between the school and our children. In our journey to provide our children with a holistic education, we believe in forging a strong working relationship with parents.

The partnership with parents aims to support parents so that are they are able and are empowered to:  
  

*   recognise and fulfill their responsibilities as parents and play an active and valued role in their children’s education
*   make their views known about how their children are educated
*   have access to information, advice and support during decision-making processes about their children’s education or special educational provision.
