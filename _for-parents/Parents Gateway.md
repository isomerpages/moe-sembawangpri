The school has embarked on Parents Gateway for all official communication with parents and legal guardians from Jul 2019.

Parents Gateway (PG) is a digital service that connects parents/legal guardians and schools on key administrative matters. PG is a one-stop mobile application for parents/legal guardians and schools to better support their child/ward’s educational journey through improved communication. This application can be downloaded from Play Store (Android users) or Apple Store (IOS users).

PG allows schools to (1) send updates and information on programmes and activities, (2) seek consent from parents/legal guardians for your child/ward’s participation in school activities and activities by external organizations and (3) general updates. It also allows parents/legal guardian to perform administrative functions of (1) providing consent for your child/ward’s participation in school activities and activities by external organization, with option for parents to seek clarification via email contact; (2) updating contact details such as mobile number, residential/other contact numbers and email address; and (3) declaring travel plans with date and time stamp when parents make the travel declaration, and many more. Parents need to update to the latest version PG App to enjoy new features. You can do so seamlessly if your PG App’s “Enable Auto-Update” feature is enabled.

  

Parents are reminded update your mobile app to the latest version when prompted via an alert through the app, in order to access the latest features of PG.  

Once again, the school thank parents for your strong support in PG.
