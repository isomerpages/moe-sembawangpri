**Introduction**  
  

Environmental sustainability has become increasingly critical, with the prevalence of current issues such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, pollution and waste management. We believe that our children need to be given early exposure to these issues and be inculcated with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to be environmentally-responsible citizens throughout their lives.

**Overview of ALP Framework**

The school’s ALP in Environmental Studies is offered to all students to enrich their educational experience and support content mastery in Science. This includes providing avenues for students to learn outside of the classroom, and apply their understanding to solve real-life environmental issues. Selected students are also given the opportunity to share their findings in nationwide competitions.

**Green Leaders**

The Green Leaders are a group of student leaders who have been selected to advocate environmental conservation efforts in the school and the community. Training is conducted for these students to deepen their knowledge in environmental issues and hone presentation skills. They also drive a food waste recycling programme during recess to encourage their peers to reduce food waste.

**Community Outreach**

Our students also share with members of the public on the importance of environmental issues, and help to impart the message of environmental conservation.

Our rooftop garden allows our students to experience the full process of growing and harvesting their own fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, they are able to gain a keen awareness of challenges faced by Singapore in terms of land scarcity and food sustainability.
