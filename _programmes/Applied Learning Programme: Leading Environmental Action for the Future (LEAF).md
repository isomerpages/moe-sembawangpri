<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme: Leading Environmental Action for the Future (L.E.A.F.)</strong>
</p>
<p>At Sembawang Primary School, we believe in nurturing environmentally conscious
citizens who are empowered to lead positive environmental change. Our Applied
Learning Programme, L.E.A.F. (Leading Environmental Action for the Future),
helps students understand and address environmental challenges such as
climate change, biodiversity loss, and waste management. Through L.E.A.F.,
we provide hands-on learning experiences that cultivate sustainable habits
while developing STEM literacy and 21st Century Competencies. The programme
aligns with MOE's Eco Stewardship Programme, guiding our students to become
responsible environmental stewards. L.E.A.F. operates at two tiers to cater
to different learning needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Tier 1 (Educate)</strong>
</p>
<p>Through our Tier 1 programmes, all students participate in year-round
activities that raise awareness of environmental issues. These include
commemorating World Water Day and Biodiversity Week, as well as the annual
Clean Plate Campaign that teaches students about reducing food waste. During
Experiential Learning Week, students engage in innovative activities, such
as our Primary 5 'Building a Smart Home' STEM project where they apply
coding skills to create sustainable living solutions.</p>

<p>The school’s ALP in Environmental Studies is offered to all students to
enrich their educational experience and support content mastery in Science.
Through partnerships with external agencies and collaboration with various
departments, students are provided with avenues to learn outside of the
classroom and apply their understanding to tackle real-life environmental
issues.</p>

<p><strong>Green Leaders</strong>
</p>
<p>The Green Leaders are a group of student leaders who have been selected
to advocate environmental conservation efforts within the school and the
community. They drive recycling efforts within the school and selected
Green Leaders also conduct sharing sessions with the school population
on environmental issues. Enrichment workshops and trainings are conducted
for these students to deepen their knowledge of environmental issues and
hone their presentation skills.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Spaces</strong>
</p>
<p>Several green learning spaces have been set up around the school to support
students’ learning in Environmental Studies. These include an eco-pond
with an inverted aquarium, solar-powered water feature, habitat tanks,
various gardening plots and a Zero Waste Hub where usual tables have been
replaced with customised ones made from pallet wood gathered from discarded
furniture.</p>
