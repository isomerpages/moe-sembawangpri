**Introduction**  
  

Environmental sustainability has become increasingly critical, with the prevalence of current issues such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, pollution and waste management. We believe that our children need to be given early exposure to these issues and be inculcated with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to be environmentally-responsible citizens throughout their lives.

**Overview of ALP Framework**

The school’s ALP in Environmental Studies is offered to all students to enrich their educational experience and support content mastery in Science. Through partnerships with external agencies and collaboration with various departments, students are provided with avenues to learn outside of the classroom and apply their understanding to tackle real-life environmental issues.

**Green Leaders**

The Green Leaders are a group of student leaders who have been selected to advocate environmental conservation efforts within the school and the community. They drive recycling efforts within the school and selected Green Leaders also conduct sharing sessions with the school population on environmental issues. Enrichment workshops and trainings are conducted for these students to deepen their knowledge of environmental issues and hone their presentation skills.

**Learning Spaces**

Several green learning spaces have been set up around the school to support students’ learning in Environmental Studies. These include an eco-pond with an inverted aquarium, solar-powered water feature, habitat tanks, various gardening plots and a Zero Waste Hub where usual tables have been replaced with customised ones made from pallet wood gathered from discarded furniture.
